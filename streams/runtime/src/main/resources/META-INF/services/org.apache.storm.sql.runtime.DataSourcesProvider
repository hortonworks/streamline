# The Storm SQL framework uses the Java library ServiceLoader to load and register the services it requires.
# ServiceLoader looks for a file under META-INF/services, and the file name must be the fully qualified name
# of the interface defining the service. Storm SQL defines the service through the interface
# org.apache.storm.sql.runtime.DataSourcesProvider, hence that being the name of this file.
# The content of the file should be a single line with the fully qualified name of the class implementing the
# service, which in this case is com.hortonworks.streamline.streams.runtime.rule.sql.RulesDataSourcesProvider

com.hortonworks.streamline.streams.runtime.rule.sql.RulesDataSourcesProvider
